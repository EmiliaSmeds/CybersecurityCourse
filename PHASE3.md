| On the login page anyone can choose to be an administrator | This issue was brough up on the lecture | This could be fixed by removing the Role-option from the register-page, and automatically register everyone as Reserver. Then use an if-statement int he code for those usernames that are administrators. Then I would add a functionality to the system where administrators could change the roles for the users, to be either a Reserver or Administrator. |
